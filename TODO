UnitDeveloper Tool. Designed for the game, "The Outforce." V3.1.

//  Upcoming updates for version V3.x

[Software improvements:]

//  Issues:

!  The mesh itself is kinda messed up. 
!  Selection default so not sure if its just to load the texture or disabled
!  The scale for the uv's is not correct. it should be -1 in the y axis

//  Fixes:

*  Fix exporting-related issues.
*  The UV's would match if its negative, however that doesnt fix the whole problem. now there's a need to get the uv's to be flipped based on their individual origins. that way it would match the texture. 

//  Additions:

+   Make it possible to add custom-made classes section files(.CUnit, .CUnitWeapon, .CGridMember, .CBaseClass); //  In progress
+   Make it possible to add custom-made image files (for background images used in the map editor for example.)
